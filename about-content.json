      "J-KIT was established out of a strong commitment to address Namibia’s pressing socio-economic challenges, including the high unemployment and poverty rates, the largely unregulated informal employment sector, and the limited opportunities available for Namibians to showcase and monetize their talents.",
      "Founded by Kleopas H.T Malima, the platform was designed to connect workers and talents directly with employers and clients. We envisioned a platform that goes beyond simply listing jobs — one that actively empowers individuals, from domestic workers and skilled trades people to entertainers, to showcase their abilities, get hired, and secure work quickly."
